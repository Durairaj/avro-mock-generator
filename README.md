Work entirely in progress.

This is a trial, it might not get completed (but hopefully will, eh), come back in a few.

To document:
- The whole thing
- namespace + union + how we select first item (also in enums)
- logical types defaulting to underlying type
- override type generator
- stuff not supported (aliases, others?)
